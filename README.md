## Facebook Demetricator 

[Facebook Demetricator](http://bengrosser.com/projects/facebook-demetricator/) is a web browser extension that removes all the metrics from the Facebook interface. Under its influence, Facebook no longer foregroudns how many friends you have or how much people like your status. Instead, these numbers are stripped away, inviting you to try the system without these things, to enable a network society that isn't so dependent on quantification. 

Facebook Demetricator runs on Chrome (as an extension distributed via the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/facebook-demetricator/dbkgglbefgkimiadfjmgnkjmaoahephg)), Safari (as a self-distributed extension), and Firefox (as a self-distributed userscript for use with Scriptish).

This project was the winner of a [Terminal Award](http://terminalapsu.org/), an annual net art award from the Center for Creative Excellence in the Arts.
